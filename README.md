PROJECT DESCRIPTION
---

Customer attrition or also known as customer churn or turnover is the loss of customers from company.

This is one of the most cases in business life, especially in service companies. As they donâ€™t want to lose the customer anymore, they will use customer attrition analysis and the rates as one of their key business metrics because the cost of retaining an existing customer is far less than acquiring a new one.

PROJECT GOALS
---

This project aims to predict customer churn by assessing their propensity of risk to churn. The model generates small prioritized list of potential defectors and it will be focused to the set of the customer base who are most vulnerable to churn.
